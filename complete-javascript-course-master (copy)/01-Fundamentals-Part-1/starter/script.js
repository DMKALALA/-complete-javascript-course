//Using Variables and Values:

let js = 'amazing';
console.log(40 + 28 + 23 - 50);
//we use console.log() as a print operation to show our values in the console
console.log("Denis");

let firstName = "Denis";
//to find out what is in the firstName variable we will output it using console.log()
console.log(firstName)

//let 5syntax = 5; this will create a syntax error

// never use capital letters at the beginning of the variable as it is legal but only used in OOP when coding in  JS.

//we use capitalized variable names for constant variables i.e let SCORE = 5;   the score will always be five
let SCORE = 5;
